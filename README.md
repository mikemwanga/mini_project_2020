# Residential Training Mini-Project
# Interrogating public datasets and paths to results on Covid19 in East Africa
## Aimed at:
1. Understand the genetic diversity between African SARS strains
2. Infer relatedness if the African SARS to global strains causing COVID-19
3. Estimate the rate of evolution of SARS in Africa
## Method
1. Extract all SARS-COVID-19 sequences from sequnce databases 
  [Wolfram Data Repository](https://datarepository.wolframcloud.com/resources/Genetic-Sequences-for-the-SARS-CoV-2-Coronavirus)
2. Perform multiple sequence alignments
3. Infer conserved and diverse genetic regions
4. Perfom phylogenetic inferences
